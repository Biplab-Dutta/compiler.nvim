[HelloWorld]
entry_point = "./project1/Main.java"
output = "./project1/bin/"                  # output directory, since javac don't take an output file

[HelloWorld2]
entry_point = "./project2/Helper.java"
output = "./project2/bin/"                  # output directory, since javac don't take an output file

[SOLUTION]
executable = "./project1/bin/Main.class"
